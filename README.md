- 👋 Hi, I am @julienmatuszak, I am 45 years old and I work as a freelance linguist.
- 👀 I am interested in all things related to programming. I prefer to work on small microservices rather than monolithic applications.
- 🌱 I followed a few curricula in Web programming and worked as a Web implementation engineer for some time but I prefer to work on core applications and as a freelancer on personal projects.
- 💞️ I am seeking a fine tuner for an online translator Web application -> https://www.linkedin.com/hiring/jobs/4111900866/detail/
- 📫 How to reach me @MatuszakJulien
- Main project:
    - Online Translator from English to French and French Canadian (React TS, PyTorch, ONNX). Check out https://www.frenchizer.com.
- Secondary projects in development:
    - Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin core): DeFi currency based on microcredit.
    - Civilization-like game (JAVA).
- Other:
    - JAVA Spring / PostgreSQL: We developed an availability tracker during the Sourcery curriculum, based on the great react-calendar-timeline library and associated with Java Spring for the BE. The application had full login (with security handling), user management, team management, time-off time management, and availability time-off display features including editing/adding/deleting functionalities, and an API with full CRUD features for interaction with the BE. I plan to recreate this app and add more features like the scrolling possibility that would allow one to switch from a month timeline to a day timeline, etc.
    - Assembly: write a NASM script that could execute a small CLI for Linux, such as a text editor or basic mathematical problems. It could be 2nd degree equation solver or memory management.
    - C/CPP/Qt: Create a card game with special rules. I am pretty fond of "belote", a Southern France card game. Rules are pretty close to the game of bridge, with trump/no trump and contract valuation assessment. I'd like to mix those rules for this unique card game, that I'd fancy calling "Trumps".
    - Python: work on everyday small scripts when required by Brilliant's daily challenges, a little bit like puzzles in chess :).
    - Hacking: my understanding is that hackers try proven techniques to access data from secure vaults, in order. Right now, the Log4J vulnerability, which is present on a big part of worldwide servers, is likely prone to attacks. The idea is to choose likely low-security servers and hack them with state-of-the-art techniques to communicate their vulnerabilities to their owners.
