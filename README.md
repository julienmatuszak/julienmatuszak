- üëã Hi, I am @julienmatuszak, I am 45 years old and I work as a freelance linguist.
- üëÄ I am interested in all things related to programming but mostly linguistic applications, and a bit fintech (blockchain, crypto).
- üå± I followed a few curricula in Web programming and worked as a Web implementation engineer for some time, but I prefer to work on core applications and as a freelancer on personal projects.
- üíûÔ∏è I am looking for developers for a online translator Web application. Other side projects include Web app developement, cryptocurrency, etc. I prefer to work on small microservices rather than monolithic applications.
- üì´ How to reach me julienmatuszak@gmail.com / @MatuszakJulien / +370 678 38473
- Main project :
    - Online Translator from English to French and French Canadian. More at https://www.frenchizer.com
- Other ideas :
    - Cryptocurrency project : DeFi currency based on microcredit.
    - React TS / JAVA Spring / PostGreSQL : We developed an availability tracker during the Sourcery curriculum, based on the great react-calendar-timeline library and associated with Java Spring for the BE. The application had full login (with security handling), user management, team management, time-off time management and availability time-off display features including editing/adding/deleting functionalities, and an API with full CRUD features for interaction with the BE. I'm planning to recreate this app and add more features like scrolling possibility that would allow to switch from a month timeline to a day timeline, etc.
    - Assembly : write a NASM script that could execute a small CLI for Linux, such as a text editor, or basic mathematical problems, e.g. 2nd degree equation solver, or memory management.
    - C/CPP/Qt : Create a card game with special rules. I am pretty fond of "belote", a Southern France card game. Rules are pretty close to bridge, with trump/no trump and contract valuation assessment. I'd like to mix those rules for this unique card game, that I'd fancy calling "Trumps".
    - Python : work on everyday small scripts when required by Brilliant's daily challenges, a little bit like puzzles in chess :).
    - Hacking : my understanding is that hackers tries proven techniques to access data from secure vaults, in order. Right now, the Log4J vulnerability, which is present on a big part of worldwide servers, is likely prone to attacks in 2022. The idea is to choose likely low-security servers and hack them with state-of-the-art techniques to communicate their vulnerabilities to their owners.
