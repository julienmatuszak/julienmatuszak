- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @julienmatuszak
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in all things programming related, Web apps, security, cryptocurrencies, hacking, hardware, software, etc.
- üå± I just followed the great Sourcery program for Devbridge in React TS / Java Spring / PostGreSQL. Didn't pass it. I have registered for the Piscine at 42heilbronn.de. TBF from mid-February.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for a beginner codding buddy to create any kind of applications : Web App developement-projects, basic cryptocurrency projects, etc. I prefer to work on small applications with one single purpose than monolithic monstrosities.

- Projects TBD :
    - React TS / JAVA Spring / PostGreSQL : We developed an availability tracker during the Sourcery curriculum, based on the great react-calendar-timeline library and associated with Java Spring for the BE. The application had full login (with security handling), user management, team management, time-off time management and availability time-off display features including editing/adding/deleting functionalities, and an API with full CRUD features for interaction with the BE. I'm planning to recreate this app and add more features like scrolling possibility that would allow to switch from a month timeline to a day timeline, etc.
    - Assembly : write a NASM script that could execute a small CLI for Linux, such as a text editor, or basic mathematical problems, e.g. 2nd degree equation solver, or memory management.
    - C/CPP/Qt : Create a card game with special rules. I am pretty fond of "belote", a Southern France card game. Rules are pretty close to bridge, with trump/no trump and contract valuation assessment. I'd like to mix those rules for this unique card game, that I'd fancy calling "Trumps".
    - Python : small everyday scripts whenever it is required by Brilliant's daily challenge.
    - Cryptocurrency : surprisingly, it's not that difficult to create a basic cryptocurrency. Of course, it's not BitCore and won't pretend to have all the features to be qualified as a currency. The idea is to build the currency with the Solidity language on the Ethereum platform, with a special emphasis on distribution through humanitarian projects. For example, the equivalent of the gas fees for Ethereum could be shared with a simple weighed distribution between payments to the miners and subsidies to selected projects by a decentralized community. 
    - Hacking : my understanding is that hackers tries proven techniques to access data from secure vaults, in order. Right now, the Log4J vulnerability, which is present on a big part of worldwide servers, is likely prone to attacks in 2022. The idea is to choose likely low-security servers and hack them with state-of-the-art techniques to communicate their vulnerabilities to their owners.
