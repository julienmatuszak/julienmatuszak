- 👋 Hi, I’m @julienmatuszak
- 👀 I’m interested in all things programming related, Web apps, security, cryptocurrencies, hacking, hardware, software, etc.
- 🌱 I just followed the great Sourcery program for Devbridge in React TS / Java Spring / PostGreSQL. Didn't pass it. I have registered for the Piscine at 42heilbronn.de. TBF from mid-February.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a beginner codding buddy to create any kind of applications : Web App developement-projects / basic cryptocurrency projects / others. I prefer to work on small applications with one single purpose than monolithic monstrosities.

- Projects TBD :
    - We developed an availability tracker during the sourcery curriculum, based on the great react-calendar-timeline library and associated with Java Spring for the BE. The application had full login feature (with security handling), user management, team management, time-off time management and availability time-off display with editing features, and the API with full CRUD features for interaction with BE. I'm planning to recreate this app and add more features like scrolling possibility that would allow to switch from a month timeline to a day timeline, etc.
